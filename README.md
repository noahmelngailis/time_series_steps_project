# Time Series Using My Iphone Data

## Time_Series_MVP
This notebook does some exploration into pedometer data over the last 2 years exported from iphone.

## Time_Series_XML
This notebook pulls in the exported health data in xml form into a notebook.  
We need to validate the data between the two data sets

This project has hit a snag because there is an issue with time calculations between 9-27-2018 and 11-12-2018


### Next Steps:
    - Reshaping xml df to have hourly walking numbers
    - EDA of that dataframe

    - Potential Classification project.  Using steps, steps per mile, and flights ascended can I calculate what days I have worked at the Hyatt.
        - Will need to get days that I worked at the Hyatt from my former employer.
